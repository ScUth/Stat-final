\chapter*{Conclusion}
From the question that we asked the respondents, we want to evaluate how demographic factors (age, weight) influence screen behavior and analyze the impact of screen duration on daily routines, including which days of the week have the highest and lowest usage.\\*[5pt]
We found that age has a weak negative relationship with screen duration, with a correlation coefficient of -0.3340. Weight does not have any relationship with screen duration, with a correlation coefficient of -0.0137. The median screen duration is 6.2024, the median weight is 60.00 and the median age is 21.\\*[5pt]
The day that most respondents have spent their screen duration is Sunday with 23.9\% and the lowest screen duration is Monday with 28.3\%. The median sleep duration is 7.34. However, we found that screen duration and sleep duration are not correlated with the correlation coefficient of -0.1431.\\*[5pt]
The flaw of this is that the majority of people who answer the survey are around 18 & 19 years old which might cause the result to be inaccurate.\\*[5pt]
