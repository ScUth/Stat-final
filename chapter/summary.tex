\chapter*{Summary}
Screen time usage is becoming an increasingly significant part of modern lifestyles. \\
\par With the rise of smartphones, tablets, and computers in daily routines, we aim to understand how much time university students spend on electronic devices, as well as how this relates to their health, habits, and overall digital well-being. We also explore which days tend to have the highest screen time and which types of applications are used the most.
